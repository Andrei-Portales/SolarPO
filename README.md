## ðŸ“„ Proyect Summary

For this occasion, an application was created capable of providing useful climatological information such as sunlight, temperature/humidity, and another series of parameters with which the user can interact and combine to achieve the best use of solar resources.

This application manages to solve the problem that was had since the information is already useful and accessible for a common user. It also offers functions that improve the user experience, such as the ability to share the content that is being analyzed with other people, to create reports on the information consulted and to be able to choose your location using an interactive map.

These aspects are extremely important since the options found in the current market do not offer an experience with such accessibility to the common user since they are designed so that people more specialized in the subject make use of them and for the same reason, they are not so friendly and easy to use.


## ðŸ“± Aplication Summary

This application was created with the objective of being able to provide useful information on solar and meteorological data so that people have the necessary information to be able to make decisions regarding the best use of these resources or simply monitor solar and environmental activity in the place where it is found or a specific location.

This application was created with the help of the Flutter Framework which allows us to create applications for different mobile platforms in a simple way and using only a single code base. This is an advantage since it can reach many devices with which anyone has the possibility of making use of this application regardless of the mobile operating system they have.

In the same way, more software tools were used such as:

- Node JS
- Digital Ocean
- Google Maps API
- Express JS
- JavaScript
- Dart
